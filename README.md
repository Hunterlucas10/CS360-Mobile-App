# CS360-Mobile-App

What were the requirements and goals of the app you developed?
The app helps users manage inventory by tracking stock levels, adding or removing items, and sending notifications when inventory is low. It's designed for small businesses, warehouse staff, and individuals who need an easy and efficient way to manage inventory.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app includes a login screen, inventory grid, and SMS permissions screen, each designed to be simple and user-friendly. I focused on clear labeling and easy navigation to ensure the app is intuitive, making the design successful by keeping the userâ€™s needs in mind.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I approached coding by building one feature at a time and testing as I went, using modular design to keep the code organized and reusable. This strategy will be helpful in future projects to ensure flexibility and maintainability.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
Testing was done using both the Android Emulator and real devices to ensure the app worked correctly. This process revealed areas that needed improvement, such as handling SMS permissions and updating the inventory grid in real-time.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
To overcome challenges, I had to innovate, especially with SMS permissions and ensuring real-time updates. I solved these by breaking down the issues and focusing on clear, functional solutions.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was especially successful in UI/UX design and database integration, creating a user-friendly interface and ensuring smooth interaction with the database for managing inventory items.
